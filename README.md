# Game_Boy-2.0
A fun and simple 2 player game for indoors.


The following has been a result of trying something new, only as a hobbyist. And the entire workload has been self managed, by me as a creator who still maintains the copyright and should be duly informed before partial/full use. 


The xml has been designed as simple as possible. The Java code is so written, as to take every corner case into consideration. The logo has been photoshoped by the same too, and made to look as elegant as possible. 


The game contains two players red and blue who combat against each other only to win a handful of loot, in the form of gold.
The players have to cross many obstacles, in order to reach the final outcome, for only the best shall survive.



Enjoy :)
